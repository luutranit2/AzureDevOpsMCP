## MCP Integration

This project is optimized for use with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients. When running as an MCP server:

- **Logging**: Automatically detects MCP mode and suppresses verbose console output to prevent notification popups
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `AZURE_DEVOPS_LOG_LEVEL`: Controls logging verbosity (0=silent, 1=errors only, 2=warnings+errors, 3=info+warnings+errors, 4=debug+all)
  - `MCP_SERVER_MODE`: Set to 'true' to force MCP mode for testing
- **Performance**: Optimized for minimal console noise while maintaining error reporting

### MCP Usage
Use the new MCP tool to analyze code review comments:

```json
{
  "tool": "analyze_code_review_comments",
  "parameters": {
    "pullRequestUrl": "https://dev.azure.com/org/project/_git/repo/pullrequest/123"
  }
}
```

Perfect for requests like: *"Please help to fix all code review comments in this PR@https://dev.azure.com/org/project/_git/repo/pullrequest/123"*
